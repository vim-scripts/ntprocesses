PLEASE READ THE INSTALL SECTION COMPLETELY.

- This plugin generates a list of NT processes that are running on the
  local NT/W2K/XP machine. You can kill any by processing K on the
  corresponding entry.
- You can open the processlist window through WinManager (as described in
  the installation section below) or by assigning a hot key. You can use
  the same hot key to open/close the window. Alternatively, you can also
  use the :NTProcesses command to open/close the processes window.
- You can choose which fields that you want to see by using the
  NtpFields command. You can select the sort fields by pressing s
  consecutively and r for reversing the sort direction.
- If you have permissions, you can view the process list in a remote m/c
  by using the NtpSetHost command. With no arguments, it prints the
  current remote host name. To switch back to the local m/c, use "." for
  the host name.
- For the sake of speed, the list of processes is cached. To see the
  latest set of processes and their states at any time, refresh the window
  by pressing 'R'.
- It requires multvals and genutils plugins to be always installed, but
  others are required only depending on your usage/setting (for a better
  experience and formatting).
